High-Level Design Document for Earthquake Damage Prediction Project.

1. Introduction

The Earthquake Damage Prediction project aims to analyze building attributes and seismic indicators to predict the level of damage caused by earthquakes. This High-Level Design (HLD) document provides an overview of the project's architecture and key components.

2. Architecture Overview

The project's architecture is divided into several components:

2.1. Data Collection

Data Source: Obtain the dataset containing building attributes, seismic indicators, and damage labels. The dataset consists of 260,000 records and 40 columns.
Data Import: Load the dataset into the project environment for analysis and modeling using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
2.2. Data Preprocessing

Handle Missing Values: Address missing data through techniques like imputation or deletion. Utilize Pandas and Scikit-learn libraries for efficient data preprocessing.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features into numerical format for machine learning compatibility. Employ techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
2.3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate Analysis: Explore individual features to understand distributions and patterns. Use visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigate relationships between features to identify correlations and insights. Analyze feature interactions and their impact on earthquake damage prediction.
Identify Duplicate Records: Detect and handle duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
2.4. Machine Learning Model Development

Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using techniques like train_test_split from Scikit-learn.
Model Selection: Choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) for earthquake damage prediction based on dataset characteristics and project requirements.
Model Training: Train selected models on the training dataset using Scikit-learn's machine learning APIs.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Utilize cross-validation techniques for robust evaluation.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve predictive performance using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Select the Best Model: Choose the most suitable and generalized model for earthquake damage prediction based on evaluation results.
2.5. Model Deployment (Future Phase)

Deploy the selected model for real-time earthquake damage prediction using frameworks like Flask or Django for web application development.
Integrate the model into a production environment or web application for accessibility, ensuring scalability and reliability.
3. Conclusion

The Earthquake Damage Prediction project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of machine learning models to predict damage levels caused by earthquakes. This HLD document serves as a guide for project development and provides a roadmap for implementing and deploying the earthquake damage prediction model.

Note: Detailed technical specifications, algorithms, and code implementation details will be provided in the project repository's  ipynb file.
